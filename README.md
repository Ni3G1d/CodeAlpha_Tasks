# 📌 Task 1 – Advanced Network Traffic Analyzer

## 📖 Overview

This project is a Python-based network monitoring tool built using **Scapy**.  
It captures live network packets and analyzes traffic similar to a basic Wireshark-style analyzer.

The tool focuses on:

- Real-time packet capture
- Protocol identification (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Source and destination IP extraction
- Port analysis
- Service detection (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH, etc.)
- DNS query extraction
- Flow-based traffic summarization
- Local traffic filtering
- Basic connection tracking

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- Npcap (for Windows packet capture)
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, Ports)

---

## 🔍 Features

- Captures only local system traffic
- Maps service names based on port numbers
- Displays connection flows instead of raw packet spam
- Shows packet count per flow
- Logs traffic activity
- Provides readable traffic summaries

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of packet structure
- TCP/IP protocol stack analysis
- Real-time traffic monitoring
- Network service identification
- Flow-based traffic tracking
- Debugging encoding and packet capture issues on Windows

# 📌 Task 2 – Advanced Phishing Awareness & Social Engineering Analysis

## 📖 Overview

This task includes a corporate-level phishing awareness training module designed to educate users about phishing attacks, psychological manipulation, and prevention strategies.

The presentation includes:

- Technical explanation of phishing
- Types of phishing attacks
- Social engineering psychology
- Real-world Instagram phishing case study
- Technical breakdown of account takeover
- Incident response and recovery
- Organizational security controls
- Knowledge assessment quiz

---

## 📚 Case Study: Instagram Account Takeover

A real-world phishing incident was analyzed where:

- A fake advertising agency approached a regular Instagram user.
- The attacker promised monetary rewards.
- The victim was instructed to add the attacker's email to account settings.
- A screenshot was requested as proof.
- Within minutes, the attacker reset the password and took full control of the account.

### Attack Type:
Social Engineering-Based Account Takeover

### Key Vulnerability:
Manipulation of account recovery settings.

---

## 🛡 Recovery & Mitigation

- Account recovery process initiated
- Identity verification completed
- Strong password set
- Two-Factor Authentication enabled
- Unauthorized email removed

---

## 🔐 Key Prevention Strategies

- Never modify recovery email for unknown requests
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication
- Verify brand collaborations independently
- Avoid sharing security setting screenshots
- Follow zero-trust verification principles

---

# 🎯 Internship Skills Demonstrated
